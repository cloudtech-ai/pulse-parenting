In DBT, this means recognizing that both accepting your child as they are and encouraging growth are important. Avoiding rigid thinking helps you respond more flexibly to your child's needs.",
      "example": "If your child is upset about a bad grade, the middle path is both validating their feelings and helping them make a plan to improve, rather than only comforting or only pushing for better results.",

The six levels range from listening and showing interest, to reflecting back what you hear, to guessing what your child might be feeling. Using higher levels of validation can help your child feel truly understood.",
