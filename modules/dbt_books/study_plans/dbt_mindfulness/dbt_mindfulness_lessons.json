      "keyConcept": "Mindfulness means paying full attention to the present moment, without judgment. It involves noticing your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings as they are, rather than getting caught up in worries or distractions. For parents, practicing mindfulness can help you respond calmly and thoughtfully to your child, even in stressful situations.",
      "example": "You\u2019re helping your child with homework and notice yourself getting frustrated. Instead of reacting, you pause, take a breath, and notice your feelings before responding.",

      "example": "Your child throws a tantrum. Instead of yelling back, you notice your rising anger and choose to speak calmly, modeling emotional control.",
