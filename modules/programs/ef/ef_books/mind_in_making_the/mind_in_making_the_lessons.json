      "goal": "Use open-ended questions to develop your child\u2019s critical thinking skills.",
      "keyConcept": "Asking open-ended questions encourages children to think deeply and reason through problems. This builds their ability to analyze situations, make decisions, and solve problems independently.",
      "example": "Instead of asking, 'Did you have fun at school?' try, 'What was the most interesting thing you learned today?'",
      "practiceTip": "Each day, ask your child one open-ended question about their experiences, encouraging them to explain their thoughts.",

      "goal": "Establish routines that help your child approach challenges constructively.",
      "keyConcept": "Children become resilient when they learn to approach problems as opportunities to learn. By guiding them through a simple problem-solving process, you help them develop confidence and persistence.",
      "example": "When your child is frustrated with a puzzle, you say, 'Let\u2019s think of different ways to try this together.'",
      "practiceTip": "When your child faces a challenge, walk them through these steps: identify the problem, brainstorm solutions, try one, and reflect on the outcome.",
      "reflectionPrompt": "How do you usually respond when your child is stuck? How might a problem-solving routine change your approach?",

      "title": "Supporting Emotional Self-Control",
      "goal": "Guide your child in recognizing and managing their emotions.",
      "keyConcept": "Emotional self-control is essential for resilience. Children need help naming their feelings and learning strategies to calm themselves, which allows them to respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively.",
      "example": "When your child is upset, you say, 'I see you\u2019re angry. Let\u2019s take a few deep breaths together before we talk about it.'",
      "practiceTip": "Teach your child a calming technique, such as deep breathing or counting to ten, and practice it together during calm moments.",

      "quizQuestion": {
        "question": "What is one way to help a child develop emotional self-control?",
