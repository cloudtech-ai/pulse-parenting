Core components include working memory, flexible thinking, and self-control. These skills are essential for planning, focusing attention, remembering instructions, and juggling multiple tasks successfully.",
      "example": "A child uses executive function when they remember to bring their homework to school, resist the urge to interrupt the teacher, and switch between math and reading assignments.",
      "practiceTip": "Try explaining executive function to your child using simple language, such as 'These are the skills that help us remember things, control our actions, and solve problems.'",
