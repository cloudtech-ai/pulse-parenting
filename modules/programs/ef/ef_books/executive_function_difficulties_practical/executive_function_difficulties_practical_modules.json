  "title": "Executive Function Difficulties: A Practical Guide to Assessment and Intervention",
  "description": "This book by Jill Fahy provides a comprehensive overview of executive function (EF) difficulties, their impact on learning and daily life, and practical strategies for assessment and intervention. It translates neuroscience research into actionable frameworks for educators, clinicians, and caregivers. The guide emphasizes real-world challenges faced by individuals with EF deficits and offers tools to support their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral regulation. Through case studies and clear explanations, it equips professionals to identify EF challenges and implement effective supports.",
