      "keyConcept": "Children who display explosive behavior are usually struggling with skills such as flexibility, frustration tolerance, and problem-solving. Their outbursts are not about being defiant or manipulative, but rather a sign that they lack the tools to cope with certain demands. Understanding this shifts our perspective from punishment to support.",
      "example": "A child throws a tantrum when asked to stop playing and get ready for bed. Instead of seeing this as defiance, consider that the child may struggle with transitions and needs help developing this skill.",
