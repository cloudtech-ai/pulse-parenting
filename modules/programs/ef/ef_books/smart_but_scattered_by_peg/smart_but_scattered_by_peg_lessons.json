They are essential for managing behavior, achieving goals, and adapting to new situations. Children rely on these skills to navigate daily routines, schoolwork, and social interactions.",
      "example": "A child uses executive skills when they remember to pack their backpack for school, resist the urge to interrupt, or follow a multi-step instruction from a parent.",
