      "goal": "Understand the definition and origins of neurodiversity.",
      "keyConcept": "Neurodiversity is the idea that differences in brain function and behavior are normal and valuable variations of the human experience. The term was first used in the late 1990s to challenge the idea that neurological differences, such as autism or ADHD, are deficits. Instead, neurodiversity recognizes that all brains are unique, and these differences can bring strengths as well as challenges.",
      "example": "A child who struggles with reading but excels at solving puzzles demonstrates a different way of thinking, not a flaw.",
      "parentTip": "When talking about your child\u2019s learning style, use positive language like 'unique' or 'different,' rather than 'problem' or 'disorder.'",

When society values different ways of thinking, it creates more inclusive environments where everyone can thrive. This shift benefits not only neurodivergent individuals but also the broader community.",
      "example": "A school that celebrates students\u2019 unique talents and learning styles helps all children feel valued and included.",
