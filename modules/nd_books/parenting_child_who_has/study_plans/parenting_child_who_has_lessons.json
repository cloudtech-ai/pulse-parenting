      "title": "What Are Intense Emotions in Children?",
      "goal": "Help parents clearly understand what 'intense emotions' mean in the context of parenting.",
      "keyConcept": "Intense emotions in children refer to feelings that are stronger, more frequent, or harder to manage than what is typical for their age. These emotions can include anger, sadness, anxiety, or excitement that quickly escalates and may seem overwhelming to both the child and parent. Recognizing that these reactions are not simply 'bad behavior' but a sign of emotional intensity is the first step toward effective support.",
      "example": "A 7-year-old becomes extremely upset and cries loudly when asked to stop playing a game, even though most children their age might only show mild disappointment.",
      "parentTip": "When your child has a big reaction, remind yourself: 'This is an intense emotion, not just misbehavior.' This mindset helps you respond with empathy instead of frustration.",

      "goal": "Enable parents to identify situations or factors that commonly trigger intense emotions in their child.",
      "keyConcept": "Children with intense emotions often react strongly to certain triggers, such as changes in routine, sensory overload, feeling misunderstood, or being told 'no.' By observing patterns in your child's reactions, you can start to anticipate and prepare for these moments, reducing the likelihood of emotional outbursts.",
      "example": "A child consistently has meltdowns when transitioning from playtime to homework, suggesting that changes in activity are a trigger.",
      "parentTip": "Keep a simple journal for a week, noting when your child has intense reactions and what happened just before. Look for patterns.",

      "keyConcept": "Emotional dysregulation means a child has difficulty managing their feelings in a way that is appropriate for the situation. This can result in outbursts, withdrawal, or behaviors that seem extreme. It's important to remember that dysregulation is not a choice; it's often a sign that a child needs help learning coping skills.",
      "example": "A child screams and throws objects when frustrated, rather than using words to express their feelings.",
      "parentTip": "When your child is dysregulated, focus on helping them calm down first before discussing the situation. Use a calm voice and offer comfort.",
