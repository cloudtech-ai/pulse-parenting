      "keyConcept": "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy that helps people understand how their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are connected. It teaches practical skills to manage difficult emotions and situations. CBT is widely used to help teens cope with stress, anxiety, and other challenges by changing unhelpful thinking patterns.",
      "example": "A teen who feels nervous about speaking in class learns through CBT that their fear comes from the thought, 'Everyone will laugh at me.' By changing this thought, they can feel less anxious and more confident.",
      "practiceTip": "When you notice your child feeling upset, ask them what they are thinking at that moment. Help them see the link between their thoughts and feelings.",

      "keyConcept": "CBT teaches that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are closely linked. A negative thought can lead to unpleasant feelings and unhelpful behaviors, while positive or realistic thoughts can lead to better emotional and behavioral outcomes. Recognizing this triangle helps teens (and parents) break negative cycles.",
      "example": "If a teen thinks, 'I'm going to fail this test,' they might feel anxious and avoid studying, which increases the chance of a poor result.",
      "practiceTip": "Draw a triangle with your child and label each corner: Thoughts, Feelings, Behaviors. Use it to talk through a recent challenge together.",
