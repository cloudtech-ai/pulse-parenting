      "goal": "Understand the definition and purpose of cognitive restructuring in CBT.",
      "keyConcept": "Cognitive restructuring is a core technique in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that helps people identify and change unhelpful or distorted thoughts. By recognizing these thoughts, we can challenge and replace them with more balanced and realistic ones. This process supports healthier emotional responses and behaviors, especially important for raising mentally healthy children.",
      "example": "A parent notices their child says, 'I'm bad at math, I'll never get it right.' The parent helps the child see this is just a thought, not a fact, and encourages them to try a different perspective.",
      "practiceTip": "When you notice your child expressing a negative thought, pause and gently ask, 'Is that really true, or is it just how you feel right now?'",
      "reflectionPrompt": "How might your own thinking patterns influence the way you respond to your child's struggles?",

        "question": "What is the main goal of cognitive restructuring?",
        "options": [

      "goal": "Learn the connection between thoughts, feelings, and actions.",
      "keyConcept": "Our thoughts shape how we feel and act. When we or our children have negative or distorted thoughts, these can lead to unhelpful emotions and behaviors. Understanding this connection is the first step in helping children develop healthier thinking habits.",
      "example": "A child thinks, 'No one wants to play with me,' which makes them feel sad and withdraw from others. The parent helps the child see that this thought might not be accurate.",
      "practiceTip": "Ask your child to describe a recent situation, what they thought, how they felt, and what they did. Help them see the links between these steps.",

      "example": "A child thinks, 'I'll never make friends.' The parent asks, 'Can you think of a time when someone wanted to play with you?'",

      "example": "Instead of 'I'm terrible at reading,' a child learns to say, 'Reading is hard for me, but I can improve with practice.'",

These thoughts can be positive, neutral, or negative, and they influence how we feel and act. Understanding automatic thoughts is the first step in helping children (and ourselves) develop healthier thinking patterns.",
      "example": "A child spills juice and immediately thinks, 'I'm so clumsy.' This thought happens instantly, without much conscious awareness.",

      "keyConcept": "Once you identify an unhelpful thought, the next step is to challenge its accuracy. Ask yourself if the thought is really true, or if there is evidence that contradicts it. Teaching your child to do this builds resilience and critical thinking.",
      "example": "Your child thinks, 'I always mess up.' You help them recall times when they succeeded, showing the thought isn\u2019t completely true.",

      "example": "Instead of 'I\u2019m bad at math,' your child learns to say, 'Math is hard for me, but I can improve with practice.'",
      "practiceTip": "Help your child rephrase one negative thought each day into a more balanced statement.",

      "example": "After a difficult week, you and your child notice more negative thoughts creeping in. Instead of giving up, you review your journals together and celebrate small wins.",
