      "keyConcept": "Parents often want to protect their children from distress, but certain responses\u2014like allowing avoidance or providing excessive reassurance\u2014can actually reinforce anxious behaviors. By identifying these patterns, parents can begin to shift their approach and support their teen's growth.",

      "goal": "Teach parents strategies to remain calm and consistent when their teen is struggling.",
      "keyConcept": "Your calm presence can help your teen feel safe and supported, especially during anxious moments. When you stay composed, you model effective coping and show your teen that difficult emotions can be managed. This doesn't mean you have to hide your feelings, but rather, respond thoughtfully instead of reacting impulsively.",
      "example": "Your teen becomes upset about an upcoming test and starts yelling. Instead of raising your voice or panicking, you take a deep breath and speak in a steady, reassuring tone.",
      "parentTip": "Before responding to your teen's anxiety, pause and take three slow breaths. This brief moment can help you respond more calmly.",

      "keyConcept": "Consistency helps your teen feel secure, especially when they're anxious or discouraged. This means responding in similar ways to similar situations, setting clear expectations, and following through with supportive actions. Consistency builds trust and reassures your teen that you are a reliable source of support.",
      "example": "Whenever your teen expresses worry about school, you listen without judgment and encourage them to use their coping skills, rather than changing your approach each time.",
      "parentTip": "Choose one supportive phrase or action you can use every time your teen faces a setback, such as 'I'm here for you, and we'll get through this together.'",

Taking time for your own self-care\u2014such as rest, hobbies, or connecting with friends\u2014replenishes your energy and patience. When you care for yourself, you model healthy habits and are better equipped to support your child.",
