It helps teens notice their thoughts, feelings, and surroundings, which can reduce stress and improve emotional balance. Understanding mindfulness is the first step to supporting your child\u2019s mental health.",
      "example": "Imagine your teen comes home upset after a tough day at school. Instead of reacting immediately, they pause, notice their feelings, and take a few deep breaths before talking about what happened.",

      "example": "Your teen feels overwhelmed by homework and extracurriculars. By practicing mindfulness, they learn to recognize stress signals and take a short break to regroup, rather than becoming frustrated or shutting down.",
