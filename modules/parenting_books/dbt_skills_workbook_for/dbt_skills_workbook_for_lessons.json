It combines acceptance and change strategies, teaching practical tools for everyday challenges. For parents, DBT offers a framework to support both themselves and their teens through difficult moments.",
      "example": "A parent feels overwhelmed when their teen slams the door after an argument. Using DBT, the parent pauses, acknowledges their own frustration, and chooses to respond calmly instead of reacting impulsively.",

      "keyConcept": "Adolescence is a time of rapid change, and teens often test boundaries as they seek independence. This can lead to misunderstandings, conflict, and emotional ups and downs for both teens and parents. Recognizing these challenges is the first step to responding with empathy and skill.",
      "example": "A teen starts spending more time alone and seems moody. The parent feels rejected but realizes this is a normal part of growing up, not a personal slight.",

Mindfulness helps you create space between your feelings and your actions, allowing you to respond in ways that support your teen\u2019s growth and your relationship.",
      "example": "Your teen forgets to do their chores again. Instead of yelling, you pause, take a breath, and calmly remind them of the agreement you made.",
