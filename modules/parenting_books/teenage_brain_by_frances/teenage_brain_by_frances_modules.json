  "description": "The Teenage Brain by Frances E. Jensen explores the unique development and challenges of adolescent brains. The book examines how changes in brain structure and function shape teen behavior, risk-taking, learning, and emotional health. Dr. Jensen blends neuroscience research with practical advice for teenagers, parents, and educators. The book aims to foster understanding and informed support for teens during this critical period of growth.",
