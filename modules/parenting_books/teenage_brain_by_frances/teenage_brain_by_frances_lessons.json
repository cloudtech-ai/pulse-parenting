In teenagers, this area is still developing and won't fully mature until their mid-20s. This means teens may act impulsively or have trouble thinking ahead, not because they don't care, but because their brains are still under construction.",

      "keyConcept": "The limbic system, which controls emotions and the desire for rewards, develops earlier than the prefrontal cortex. This can make teens more sensitive to emotional highs and lows, and more likely to seek out excitement or take risks. Their feelings may seem overwhelming, but this is a normal part of brain development.",
      "example": "Your teen gets extremely upset over a minor disagreement with a friend and reacts dramatically. Their emotional response is amplified by their developing limbic system.",

      "keyConcept": "During adolescence, the brain\u2019s reward system is especially sensitive, making teens more likely to seek out novel and thrilling experiences. This heightened sensitivity means that activities which seem risky or impulsive to adults can feel especially rewarding to teenagers.
