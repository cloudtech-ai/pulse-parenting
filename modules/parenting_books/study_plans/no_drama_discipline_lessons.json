      "keyConcept": "Discipline is about teaching children how to make better choices, while punishment is about making them suffer for their mistakes. When we discipline, we guide and support our children\u2019s growth rather than simply imposing consequences. This approach helps children learn, rather than just fear doing something wrong.",
      "example": "When a child spills milk, punishment might be sending them to their room. Discipline, on the other hand, involves calmly showing them how to clean up and discussing how to be more careful next time.",
      "parentTip": "Next time your child misbehaves, pause and ask yourself: 'Am I teaching or just punishing?' Focus on what your child can learn from the situation.",
