      "goal": "Recognize how discipline differs from punishment and why this matters for your child\u2019s development.",
      "keyConcept": "Discipline is about teaching and guiding children, while punishment focuses on making them suffer for mistakes. When you discipline, you help your child learn better ways to handle situations. Punishment, on the other hand, can create fear and resentment, making it harder for your child to grow and trust you.",
      "example": "If a child hits their sibling, punishment might be sending them to their room alone. Discipline would involve calmly talking to the child about why hitting hurts, and guiding them to express their feelings with words instead.",
      "parentTip": "Next time your child misbehaves, pause and ask yourself: 'Am I teaching or just reacting?' Choose to guide rather than punish.",

      "example": "When a child throws a tantrum because they can\u2019t have a toy, instead of yelling, a parent might help the child name their feelings and suggest ways to calm down, like taking deep breaths.",

This means that kids often act impulsively or have big feelings because their brains aren't fully equipped to manage them yet. Recognizing this can help you respond with empathy instead of frustration.",
