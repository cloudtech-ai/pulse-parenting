The book emphasizes understanding children's emotions, connecting with them, and guiding behavior through empathy and clear boundaries. It offers neuroscience-backed insights and practical tools to reduce conflict and foster healthy development. The focus is on teaching rather than punishing, helping children learn from their mistakes and strengthening parent-child relationships.",
